# leaflet_challenge


Description
Using information from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Leaflet, I was able to create a map that shows all of the earthquakes that happened within the seven day previous to when I pulled the data from USGS. The earthquakes are designated by a circle marker, the larger the circle the greater the magnitude. The circle markers also change color to reflect the depth of the earthquake. The legend at the bottom right of the map gives an indication of the depth. 


Visuals and Usage:
There are multiple overlays to this dataset. The base map can change and then the earthquakes and tectonic plates can be added and removed from the map independently.

Installation
This code was build using html, JavaScript, and Leaflet graphs. Using the Live Server in Visual Studio helps to view the resulting html as the code is being built.

Authors and acknowledgment
This project was completed by Kelsey Brantner. 
In addition to in class assignments, this project was assisted by David Chou, a tutor, who helped me understand how to code different map overlays, including the tectonic plates, how to style parts of the legend, and how to extract the data to make a circle marker. I also referenced the following code to learn about styling a circle marker:
